// Challenge: In a room there are a mixture of people and dogs. There are 72 heads, and 200 legs. How many dogs are in the room? (No tricks, no chromosomal abnormalities, no disabilities â€¦)

dogs + humans = 72;
4(dogs) + 2(humans) = 200;

humans = 72 - dogs;

4(dogs) + 2(72 - dogs) = 200;
4(dogs) + 144 - 2(dogs) = 200;
4(dogs) - 2(dogs) = 56;
2(dogs) = 56;

dogs = 28;
